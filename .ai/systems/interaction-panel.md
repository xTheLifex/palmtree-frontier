# System: Interaction Panel (Sandstorm port)

> Ported from **Sandstorm-Station-13** (BYOND) `modular_sand/code/datums/interactions/` and
> `tgui/packages/tgui/interfaces/MobInteraction/`. Scope: the "core tame" interaction set only;
> lewd interactions are gated by a session consent toggle and resolved from genital markings.

## Purpose

Lets a player open a tabbed panel on another character (or themselves) and perform data-driven
social/lewd interactions: chat emote + sound + lust/moaning/climax, with search, favorites and
auto-repeat. Sandstorm's organ-based genitals, pregnancy, refractory period, vore and extreme
content are intentionally not ported.

## How it works

1. **Opening.** Right-click verb `interaction-verb-open` ("Interact with...") or the
   `InteractWithEntity` keybind (Ctrl+Shift+left click, `mod1: Control`, `mod2: Shift`). The server
   `PointerInputCmdHandler` in `InteractionPanelSystem` mirrors `PullController`'s server-side
   binding. Range is 6 tiles. **Clicking empty space opens the panel on yourself**, which is how the
   self (masturbation) actions are reached; the panel can also target yourself through the verb on
   your own body.
2. **Binding.** The BUI is opened on the *actor*, not the target
   (`_ui.OpenUi(user, InteractionUiKey.Key, user)`). This engine version has one state per
   `(entity, key)`, so binding to the actor avoids users sharing a state; the target travels in
   `InteractionBoundUserInterfaceState.Target`. The target must carry
   `InteractionPanelComponent` (organic humanoids).
3. **Requirements.** `InteractionPrototype.UserRequirements`/`TargetRequirements` are lists of
   `InteractionRequirements` names (parsed in code to avoid YAML flag-enum issues; the C# field is
   `List<string>`). `Mouth` fails on ingestion blockers (mask), `Hands` needs a `HandsComponent`.
   Genital flags resolve through `GenitalSystem`, which now reads **genital organs** (see
   `systems/genital-organs.md`), not markings:
   - Presence comes from `GenitalOrganComponent`s on the mob (penis, vagina, balls, breasts, plus
     butt/belly which have no interaction requirements yet).
   - Exposure follows the organ's SPLURT-style visibility rule (Always hidden / Hidden by underwear /
     Hidden by jumpsuit / Never hidden), checked against the jumpsuit slot and visible undergarment
     markings.
   - The anus is simulated (no organ): humanoids always have one, exposed when bottomless.
   - Both `Exposed` and `Unexposed` in one list means "any state, but must have the genital".
   - `InteractionFlags.UserIsTarget` marks self-only actions; `InteractionFlags.SelfOrOther`
     (used by the manual Climax) allows both self and other targets.
4. **Consent.** `InteractionStateComponent.Consent` (session-only, default **on**) gates every
   `InteractionType.Lewd` entry for both actor and target. Turning it off in the Preferences tab
   blocks others (and yourself). Per-marking `OtherCanToggleVisible` remains the gate for others
   revealing genitals. There is still no persisted consent system.
5. **Effects.** `TryPerform` sends an emote through `ChatSystem.TrySendInGameICMessage`
   (`InGameICChatType.Emote`, `ChatTransmitRange.Normal`) for normal interactions, or builds a
   purple-wrapped message (`#c060ff`) and sends it through `IChatManager.ChatMessageToManyFiltered`
   for lewd ones (the emote path strips markup). It plays the prototype's sound (lewd sounds are
   filtered to sessions in range whose `LewdSounds` is on; normal sounds use PVS), applies
   intro/continuing message selection (same interaction + target within `ContinueTimeout`), faces
   the participants, then applies lust.
6. **Arousal.** `EnsureState` randomizes tolerance (75-200) and potency (10-25) per mob once. Lust
   decays 1/s on read. Lewd interactions add 20 by default (self actions 30/20, ass slap 10; kiss
   sets at least 10) and arouse the
   involved organs (which swaps their render markings). Optional per-player lust-gain and
   moaning-chance multipliers live in the Preferences tab. Moans use Sandstorm's quadratic bezier
   between `tolerance*1.5` and `tolerance*3`, with the "You struggle to not orgasm!" self-popup;
   climax at `tolerance*3` resets lust and plays `final_*` sounds. Repeating the same interaction
   uses `continueMessages` when provided.
7. **Climax fluids / drip.** `InteractionPrototype.CumTarget` (`vagina`/`anus`/`mouth`/`exterior`)
   maps a climax: internal endings store the penis organ's `SemenVolume` in the partner's
   `DrippingCumComponent` (1 u/s **droplet** decals while not wearing a jumpsuit; drips never grow
   into the full puddle decals), exterior endings drop the full `SemenPuddle*` decals on the ground.
   A null cum target (manual Climax with no recent interaction) is treated as an exterior climax on
   the actor. Receiver-side acts (`Ride`, `TakeAnal`) reuse the same cum target for the **target's**
   climax, so the penetrator finishing fills the actor. Each interaction can define
   `cumMessages` for a context-sensitive finish line (e.g. breastfuck "cums all over {target}'s
   breasts"); the generic per-target text is the fallback. The **Cum on them** action is a
   `forceClimax` exterior action with no orgasm gate; the **Climax** action (`forceClimax`) has no
   range or orgasm requirement, is usable on self or others, and reuses the last interaction's cum
   target when it has none of its own. Both go through the same `TriggerClimax`/`EmitClimax` code.
   **Multi-pulse climax:** a climax splits `SemenVolume` into 30u pulses (max 10, so 300u = 10
   pulses). The first pulse fires immediately; the rest follow every 0.6s from the server `Update`
   loop, each placing a decal/drip, sending the cum message and moaning. While
   `InteractionStateComponent.ClimaxPulsesLeft > 0` the actor cannot start another climax
   (`CanPerform`/`TryPerform` reject `ForceClimax`) and climaxing participants gain no lust from
   interactions (fail-safe against re-triggering). See `systems/genital-organs.md`.
8. **Auto-repeat.** The server `Update` loop repeats the active interaction every `AutoPace`
   (Sandstorm's `interaction_speeds`: 4/2/1/0.8/0.5 s) without the 0.5 s cooldown, stopping on any
   requirement failure, target deletion or range loss. The same loop also pushes a fresh panel state
   to every open panel once per second, so lust bars, attribute lines and availability update over
   time instead of only after an interaction.
9. **Favorites** are session-only (`InteractionStateComponent.Favorites`) because this fork has no
   profile storage for them.

## Content

- Prototypes are defined in `Resources/Prototypes/_PS/Interactions/interactions.yml`.
- Ported normal interactions: handshake, pat, cheer, high-five, headpat, salute, fistbump, pinky
  promise, bird, hold hand, hug (hug is new; Sandstorm had the sound but no datum).
- Ported lewd interactions: kiss, titgrope, blowjob, oral (cunnilingus), handjob, finger,
  finger ass, fuck (vaginal), fuck anal, breastfuck, frotting, tribadism, nipple suck, ass slap,
  ride + take anal (receiver-side penetration, the target's climax fills the actor), self actions
  (jerk off, finger yourself, finger your rear, grope your own breasts), cum on them (manual
  exterior action) and climax (manual orgasm button, usable on self or others at any time).
- Not ported: breastfeeding, feet (footjob/footfuck/grinding/licking), facefuck/throatfuck,
  rimjob, mounting/thigh smothering, nuts-to-face/nut smack, cursed (ear/eye) content,
  and everything depending on pregnancy/refractory period/multi-orgasm gating/estrous traits.
- Audio: 47 ogg files copied from Sandstorm's `modular_sand/sound/interactions/` plus
  `sound/weapons/slap.ogg`; see `Resources/Audio/_PS/Interactions/attributions.yml`.

## Organs (implemented)

The old genital markings were replaced by player-configured **genital organs** in character
creation; `GenitalSystem` now reads `GenitalOrganComponent`s. The marking library survives as the
render backend (hidden from the editor, stripped from old profiles). Semen volume and the drip live
in the same system. Full details: `systems/genital-organs.md`.

## Hazards

- `SharedPopupSystem.PopupCursor` broadcasts on the server; requirement failures must use
  `PopupEntity(message, subject, actor)` so only the acting player sees them.
- BUI state is per entity, not per user — do not bind this panel to the target without adding a
  per-user channel.
- Requirement/flag lists are strings (see `InteractionPrototype`); a typo silently drops the
  requirement. Add entries carefully and keep names in sync with `InteractionRequirements`/
  `InteractionFlags`.
- Exposure is now the jumpsuit rule on organs; the `Genital` marking flags no longer drive
  requirements. Do not reintroduce marking-based checks in requirement code.
- Lewd emotes must go through `SendErpEmote` (purple); the standard chat path strips markup. Both
  `SendErpEmote` and the lewd sound filter drop sessions attached to a `GhostComponent`, so
  observers (including admin ghosts) never receive ERP text or sounds.
- The entity event bus allows **one subscription per (component, event) pair across all systems**.
  `MarkingVisibilityChangedEvent` is owned by `GenitalOrganSystem`; the client
  `HumanoidAppearanceSystem` must not subscribe to it. Local preview refreshes go through
  `HumanoidAppearanceSystem.RefreshSprite`.

## Validation

- `Content.IntegrationTests/Tests/_PS/InteractionPanelTest.cs` covers profile-driven organ
  creation, jumpsuit exposure gating, consent, cooldowns, receiver-side/self interactions, manual
  climax decals, droplet-only drips, remote client genital rendering, and NetSerializable
  round-trips of the UI state/messages.
- `ServerDbSqliteTests` round-trips the persisted `Genitals` string (`CharlieCharlieson`) and
  guards migration drift.
- The standard pipeline (solution build, YAMLLinter, unit tests, targeted integration tests,
  headless client IL check) is expected to pass.
