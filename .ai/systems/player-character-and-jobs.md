# System: Player, Character, Jobs & Species

## Purpose

How a connection becomes a character with a profile, species, markings, loadouts and job; plus the
species roster in this repo.

## Locations

| Piece | Path |
|---|---|
| Sessions/players | `Content.Server/Players/*`, engine `ICommonSession` |
| Preferences | `Content.Server/Preferences/*`, `Content.Shared/Preferences/*` |
| Profile data | `Content.Shared/Preferences/HumanoidCharacterProfile.cs`, `HumanoidCharacterAppearance.cs` |
| Species prototypes | `Resources/Prototypes/Species/*`, `_DV/Species`, `_NF/Species`, `Nyanotrasen/Species`, `_CS/Species`, `_EE/Species` |
| Species mobs | `Resources/Prototypes/Entities/Mobs/Species/*` and prefix equivalents |
| Jobs/loadouts | `Resources/Prototypes/Roles/Jobs/*`, `Resources/Prototypes/_NF/Loadouts/*` |
| Job systems | `Content.Server/Station/Systems/StationJobsSystem.cs`, `StationSpawningSystem.cs` |
| Mind | `Content.Server/Mind/*`, `Content.Shared/Mind/*` |
| Markings | see `.ai/systems/marking-and-appearance.md` |

## Flow

1. Client connects; `PlayerSystem`/`PlayerManager` track sessions.
2. Character editor edits `HumanoidCharacterProfile` (name, species, appearance, markings, loadouts,
   traits, job priorities, bank balance). Profile saved to DB on slot save.
3. Round spawn: `GameTicker` → `RulePlayerSpawningEvent` → `StationSpawningSystem.SpawnPlayerMob`
   (job + profile + station) → NF bank/loadout hooks → `HumanoidAppearanceSystem.LoadProfile`.
4. Mind attaches to the mob (`MindSystem`); job roles/objectives attach to the mind.
5. Disconnect/cryo persists the profile; mob is deleted or stored.

## Species roster (this repo)

| Species | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Human, Dwarf, Moth, Reptilian, SlimePerson, Vox, Diona, Arachnid, Skeleton, Gingerbread | core | all have `kind` + Floof layers |
| Harpy, Vulpkanin | `_DV` | have digitigrade `altSprites` |
| Felinid, Oni | `Nyanotrasen` | |
| Goblin, Sheleg | `_NF` | have digitigrade `altSprites` |
| Rodentia | `_DV` (ported) | 999-point tail/ears defaults, digileg support, rat speech |
| Anthromorph | `_CS` (ported) | BasicHumanlike + BasicFurry, custom body sprites |
| Tajaran | `_EE` (ported) | body/markings/sprites/damage/names, Felinid component |
| IPC | — | **not present** (deferred; see `.ai/PORTING.md` §6) |

All playable species carry `kind` lists so Floof/Coyote markings apply via `kindAllowance`.

## Jobs and loadouts

- Jobs are prototypes under `Resources/Prototypes/Roles/Jobs` + `_NF/Roles`; loadout groups are
  `loadoutGroup` prototypes; jobs reference groups/subgroups.
- The contractor chain (`_NF/Loadouts/contractor_loadout_groups.yml`) is the common case; Palmtree
  added `CoyoteJumpsuit` as a subgroup in 19 job group files, plus entries for the concealment
  implanter, clicker, leather satchel and foot protectors.
- `RoleLoadout` stores selected loadouts per group; `StationSpawningSystem` applies them.

## Markings in the profile

- Markings live in `HumanoidCharacterAppearance.Markings` and are persisted in the profile JSON
  (DB string format, see `.ai/PERSISTENCE.md`).
- `LegStyle` is part of the appearance and is exported/imported.
- Traits exist upstream but the 46 Coyote trait ids are not ported; unknown traits are filtered on
  import.

## Ghosts / antags

- Ghost/observer systems are upstream; upstream antag presets are inert (`rules: []`).
- NF pirate/adventure presets provide the live round flavor; `_NF/GameRule` and `Events` add
  station events.

## Unknowns

- Which jobs use which loadout groups on the live server.
- IPC direction; see `.ai/PORTING.md`.
