# System: Frontier (`_NF`) Systems

> Summary of the parent fork's gameplay layer. Verify specifics against `_NF` source when relying on
> them; this repo does not modify most of it.

## Purpose

Frontier turns SS14 into a hub-and-ships sandbox: a station (Nash) with NFSD, player-owned shuttles,
sectors/POIs, a player economy, salvage/expeditions and missions. Station antagonists are disabled by
default (`rules: []` in upstream presets).

## Locations

`Content.Server/_NF`, `Content.Shared/_NF`, `Content.Client/_NF`, `Resources/Prototypes/_NF`,
`Resources/Locale/en-US/_NF`, `Resources/Maps/_NF`.

## Major systems

| System | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Bank | `_NF/Bank` | Accounts, ATM, transfers, loadout/round payouts |
| Shipyard | `_NF/Shipyard` | Ship purchase/sale/consoles/records, drydock |
| Shuttle records | `_NF/ShuttleRecords` | Ownership and registration |
| Market | `_NF/Market` | Market consoles, pricing, whitelist modifiers |
| Cargo | `_NF/Cargo/Systems` | Frontier cargo ordering/selling |
| Salvage/expeditions | `_NF/Salvage`, `Content.Server/Salvage` | Expeditions, dungeons, debris, magnets |
| Cryo | `_NF/CryoSleep` | Cryo pods, despawn/return |
| Pirates | `_NF/Pirate`, `_NF/Cargo/Systems/NFCargoSystem.PirateBounty.cs` | Pirate bounty database |
| Bounty contracts | `_NF/BountyContracts` | Contract offers/UI |
| Medical bounties | `_NF/Medical/MedicalBounty*` | Medical bounty redemption |
| NPCs | `_NF/NPC` | Hostile/friendly NPCs for dungeons/expeditions |
| Trade/smuggling | `_NF/Trade`, `_NF/Smuggling` | Trade outposts, contraband |
| Mail | `_NF/Mail` | Mail delivery |
| Size attributes | `_NF/SizeAttribute` | `ShortWhitelist`/`TallWhitelist` (used by Rodentia/Anthromorph) |

## Round/station integration

- Game presets: `Resources/Prototypes/_NF/game_presets.yml` (`NFAdventure`, `NFPirate`, `NFTest`).
- `GameTicker.NFSpawning.cs` (partial `GameTicker`, intentional namespace collision) hooks spawn to
  apply NF loadouts and bank balance.
- Station maps/pools: `NFMapPool`; default map `Frontier`.
- NPC/faction presets live under `_NF` prototypes (`ai_factions.yml`, GameRules, Events).

## Prototype areas (partial)

`Resources/Prototypes/_NF` contains: `Bank`, `Shipyard`, `Catalog`, `Cargo`, `Loadouts`, `NPCs`,
`Entities/Mobs/NPCs`, `Events`, `GameRules`, `Missions`-adjacent bounty content, `Sectors`, `POI`,
`Salvage`, `Shipyard`, `Trade`, `VendingMachines`, and more.

## Palmtree interactions with `_NF`

- Contractor loadout groups are extended with `_PS` (concealment implanter), `_CS` (Bayou clothes,
  leather satchel), `_DEN` (foot protectors, clicker) loadouts.
- `_PS` lobby backgrounds/music are separate from `_NF/lobbyscreens.yml`.
- No `_NF` core logic was changed by the port except loadout group lists.

## Unknowns

- Which NF systems are actually active under the live config.
- Balance/reachability of ported `_PS` weapons and Bayou clothing.
