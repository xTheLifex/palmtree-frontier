# HAZARDS

> Things a future AI agent can easily get wrong. None of these are bugs to "fix" as part of documentation.

## 1. Client sandbox type checking (high risk for new shared/client code)

The client runs the engine's IL type checker (`res.typecheck`). Only whitelisted BCL APIs are allowed
in `Content.Shared` and `Content.Client`. A violation crashes the client at startup with
`Assembly Content.Shared failed type checks`, not a compile error.

Observed failure: `string.Create(IFormatProvider, ref DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler)` is blocked.
`float.ToString(IFormatProvider)`, `CultureInfo`, `System.Single` (`All: True`) and `Enum`
(`All: True`) are allowed; most `string` members are individually whitelisted.
Whitelist lives in `RobustToolbox/Robust.Shared/ContentPack/Sandbox.yml`.

To verify locally without a display:
`dotnet run --project Content.Client -c Debug --no-build -- --headless` → look for
`Content.Shared: Verified IL` / `Content.Client: Verified IL`; the process then dies on OpenGL,
which is expected. There is no sandbox check in `Content.IntegrationTests`.

## 2. Marking filters must be kind-aware

There are several places that filter markings by species; all must use
`MarkingManager.IsAllowedBySpeciesOrKindAllowance`:

- `MarkingManager.MarkingsByCategoryAndSpecies(AndSex)`
- `MarkingManager.IsValidMarking`
- `MarkingManager.CanBeApplied` (both overloads)
- `MarkingsSet.EnsureSpecies`

Using `SpeciesRestrictions.Contains(species)` directly silently strips markings shared through
`kindAllowance` (e.g. `FeroxiTorsoCountershadingF` on a Vulpkanin).

Also remember `onlyWhitelisted` logic: a marking counts as whitelisted if it has
`speciesRestriction` **or** `kindAllowance`.

## 3. `MarkingsSet.EnsureDefault` loop

The loop must be `while (points.Points > 0 && index < points.DefaultMarkings.Count)`. Using `||`
indexes past `DefaultMarkings` whenever points > defaults (Rodentia uses 999 points with one default
marking) and crashes entity spawning. It also skips categories that already have markings (so
imported characters are not given defaults on top).

## 4. Fork-patched upstream files

Frontier and this port edit upstream files in place, marked with `// Frontier`, `// Coyote`,
`// Palmtree`, `// Floof`, `// _CS`, etc. Never assume a core file is untouched upstream. Grep for
markers before editing. Keep patches minimal and annotated.

Notable in-place patches added by this port:

- `Resources/Prototypes/Entities/Clothing/Back/backpacks.yml` — `ConcealableClothing` on
  `ClothingBackpack`.
- `Content.Server/GameTicking/GameTicker.LobbyBackground.cs` — 30s rotation timer + status broadcast.
- `Content.Client/Lobby/LobbyState.cs` + `LobbyGui.xaml(.cs)` — background crossfade.
- Species YAML (`Resources/Prototypes/Species/*`, `_DV`, `_NF`, `Nyanotrasen`, `_CS`) — new layers,
  `kind`, `altSprites`.
- `Resources/Prototypes/_NF/Loadouts/**` — `CoyoteJumpsuit` subgroups and extra loadout entries.
- `Content.Shared/Movement/Pulling/Systems/PullingSystem.cs` — mass-based pull slowdown for heavy
  pulled entities (`// Palmtree`).
- `Content.Server/Body/Systems/RespiratorSystem.cs` — skips entities with `SynthComponent`.
- `Content.Client/Clothing/ClientClothingSystem.cs` — leg-style displacement override.
- All species-restricted markings — `kindAllowance` added (915 markings across 39 files), so
  markings are shared across species kinds like Coyote did.

## 5. Deliberate namespace collisions for partial classes

Fork code extends upstream classes from `_NF`/`_PS` folders using the upstream namespace, e.g.
`Content.Server/_NF/GameTicking/GameTicker.NFSpawning.cs` declares
`namespace Content.Server.GameTicking; // Intentionally colliding namespaces`. Compile errors like
"partial class already has member" usually mean a duplicate hook in an unexpected folder. Always
`grep -rn "partial class GameTicker"`.

## 6. Engine is off-limits

`RobustToolbox/` is a submodule and the maintainer context says only Wizden modifies the engine. If a
fix seems to require engine changes, document it as an engine dependency instead.

## 7. Engine APIs that differ from public documentation

This engine revision (v267.3.0) differs from commonly documented SS14 APIs:

- **No `[EventHandler]` attribute** — explicit `Subscribe*` calls only.
- **No `[DependsOn]`** — use `UpdatesBefore/UpdatesAfter` in `Initialize`.
- **No `GetPVSInterest`**; PVS uses `SessionSpecific`, `SendOnlyToOwner`, `PvsOverrideSystem`,
  `ExpandPvsEvent`, filters.
- **No `PrototypeReloadEvent`** — use `PrototypesReloadedEventArgs`.
- **No `EntityDeletedEvent`** bus event; only the C# `EntityManager.EntityDeleted` event.
- **No `RoundEndedEvent`**; use `RoundEndMessageEvent` + `GameRunLevelChangedEvent`.
- **No `RoundIdle`**; run levels are `PreRoundLobby`, `InRound`, `PostRound`.
- Map format is **7**.
- `EntityQueryEnumerator<T>` skips paused entities; use `AllEntityQueryEnumerator<T>` to include them.
- Component/field renames observed during the port: `SoundOnTrigger` → `EmitSoundOnTrigger`,
  `OnUseTimerTrigger` → `TimerTrigger`, `ImplantImplantedEvent.Implanted` is now non-nullable.
  Old Coyote prototypes may use the old names.

## 8. Broadcast vs directed events

`RaiseLocalEvent<T>(msg)` never calls `SubscribeLocalEvent<TComp,TEvent>` handlers. If a handler
"doesn't fire", check the raise overload and whether the event is `[ComponentEvent]`.

## 9. Subscription lock

Subscribe only in `Initialize()`. Subscribing later throws "Subscription locked." after startup. Use
`Subs` helpers for CVar/C# event handlers so they auto-unsubscribe on shutdown.

## 10. YAMLLinter staleness and strictness

- Runtime prototype loading logs and skips per-file errors; a broken YAML may only appear as a
  missing entity at runtime.
- `dotnet run --project Content.YAMLLinter --no-build` runs the previously built output **including
  its copied `Content.Shared.dll`**. After C# changes (new enum values, new prototype fields), rebuild
  the linter or the solution first, or you will get bogus errors like
  `Requested value 'BaseLegs' was not found`.
- Unknown prototype fields are errors in the linter, even though runtime deserialization of
  non-prototype data (e.g. character exports) ignores them.
- `ProtoId` fields are validated: an `altSprites` entry pointing at a marking that does not exist
  fails the linter.

## 11. Locale duplicates

Adding a locale key that already exists anywhere in `Resources/Locale/<culture>` fails prototype
loading with `already exist entry of type: Message`. When porting locale files, check for keys that
already exist (the ported `_Floof/anthro.ftl` already contained the leg-style keys that were also
added to `markings-picker.ftl`; the duplicate was removed).

**Fluent (`.ftl`) has no inline comments.** Text after a value is part of the translated string, so
`chat-radio-traffic = Shortband # Palmtree...` renders the comment in-game; it has to be removed by
hand. Comments are only allowed on their own `#` line (common in this repo), never at the end of a
value line.

## 12. DB and persistence

- `LogType` numeric values are persisted; do not renumber.
- Migrations exist twice (SQLite + Postgres); update both or a provider breaks.
- Character markings are stored in `Profile.Markings` (jsonb) as strings:
  `markingId@#rrggbb,...` with optional `@scale,offsetX,offsetY`, `@g...`, `@m<flags>` and
  `@c<name>` suffixes. The parser tolerates every older format and defaults to
  `CanToggleVisible=false`, `OtherCanToggleVisible=false` when the flags segment is absent (old saves
  have no flags segment, so non-undergarment markings become non-toggleable; undergarments are
  re-enabled by `MarkingsSet.ApplyDefaultTogglePermission`). Changing
  this format requires updating `Marking.ToString` **and** `Marking.ParseFromDbString`.
- No consent tables exist; no migrations were added by the port.

## 13. ERP/marking semantics

- Genital markings start hidden: `SharedHumanoidAppearanceSystem.AddMarking` sets `Visible = false`
  for `MarkingCategories.Genital`. Visibility is session state (not persisted in the DB string);
  characters get hidden genitals again after respawn/relog. `ModifyUndies` flips `Marking.Visible`
  via `SetMarkingVisibility`.
- `ModifyUndies` has no consent gate: other players can toggle a marking only when its
  `otherCanToggleVisible` opt-in is set (default off). The old consent-gated behavior was
  intentionally dropped.
- Base markings (`Base*` categories) hide the species base layer via `HiddenBaseLayers`; the list is
  rebuilt on every `UpdateLayers` and must be recomputed before hiding.
- Profile application: `SharedHumanoidAppearanceSystem.LoadProfile` must use the
  `AddMarking(uid, Marking marking, colors, ...)` overload. The `(string, colors)` overload creates a
  fresh marking and silently drops `scale`, `offset` and `glow` (symptom: editor preview shows the
  values, in-game they are defaults).
- Interaction panel (`systems/interaction-panel.md`):
  - The panel BUI is opened on the **actor**, not the target: this engine has one BUI state per
    `(entity, key)`, so binding it to the target would share state between different users.
  - `InteractionPrototype` requirement/flag lists are **strings** parsed with `Enum.TryParse`; a typo
    silently drops the requirement (no linter check).
  - Genital exposure follows the per-organ visibility rule (Always hidden / Hidden by underwear /
    Hidden by jumpsuit / Never hidden); the `Genital` marking flags are only used for rendering.
    Missing `InteractionStateComponent` means "consent on / hears lewd sounds" (defaults are the
    absence of state).
  - "Never hidden" sets `Marking.RenderOverClothing`, which the client uses to place the genital
    layer above `outerClothing`; "Always hidden" skips the render marking entirely. The `Genital`
    sprite layer must stay below `UndergarmentBottom` in species sprite maps or bottom underwear
    will not occlude organs.
  - `SharedPopupSystem.PopupCursor` broadcasts on the server; requirement failures use
    `PopupEntity(message, subject, actor)` so only the actor sees them.
  - Normal interaction sounds use PVS but lewd sounds are hand-filtered to sessions with
    `LewdSounds` enabled; do not route normal sounds through the lewd filter.
- Genital organs (`systems/genital-organs.md`):
  - `GenitalOrganSystem.SyncFromProfile` runs from a profile event that also fires during
    `ComponentInit`; guard on `BodyComponent.RootContainer != null` or it NREs before MapInit.
  - The client `HumanoidAppearanceSystem.LoadProfile` override does not call the shared method, so
    the lobby preview needs its own `SyncFromProfile` + `UpdateSprite` call; remote players get
    networked organ entities and the server-side render markings.
  - Organ render markings are added with `CanToggleVisible = false`; otherwise ModifyUndies exposes
    them as toggle verbs. The catalog is generated (`Tools/gen_genital_organ_catalog.py`), do not
    hand-edit `genital_organs.yml`.
  - Visibility gates rendering, not just layer overlap: covered organs are removed from the
    `Genital` marking category. Keep the `DidEquipEvent`/`DidUnequipEvent` (jumpsuit) and
    `MarkingVisibilityChangedEvent` (undies) subscriptions in `GenitalOrganSystem` or the sprite
    desyncs from clothing.
  - `Profile.Genitals` is a text column; changing `GenitalOrganSettings.ToDbString` requires updating
    `FromDbString`, `ServerDbBase.ConvertProfiles` and both providers' data (no schema change needed
    for format tweaks, but migration drift tests must stay green).
  - The semen drip uses `DecalPrototype`s (`SemenDrip*`/`SemenPuddle*`) via `DecalSystem`, not
    reagent puddles. It needs a grid with `DecalGridComponent` (no decals in space) and the decals
    are only removable while `Cleanable` (space cleaner's `CleanDecalsReaction`). Drips only place
    `SemenDrip*`; `SpawnCumDecals` places `SemenPuddle*`. Decals are placed at the mob's position
    with scatter and each drop is a **new** decal (no upgrading/replacing); scattered positions that
    land on space fall back to the mob's exact position. `GetDecalsInRange` compares against
    `coordinate + (0.5, 0.5)`, so queries must account for that offset.
  - Never raise `MarkingVisibilityChangedEvent` (or call `SyncRender`) while enumerating
    `MarkingSet.Markings`: the handler rebuilds the `Genital` category and mutates the dictionary.
    `SetMarkingVisibility` raises after its loop; the editor snapshots undergarment markings before
    toggling them.
  - The event bus allows only one subscription per (component, event) pair across all systems.
    `GenitalOrganSystem` owns `MarkingVisibilityChangedEvent`; the client `HumanoidAppearanceSystem`
    must use its `RefreshSprite` method for local preview toggles instead of subscribing too.
  - `GenitalOrganSystem` retries profiles applied before the body parts exist (admin respawns,
    deferred MapInit) via `_pendingProfiles`; dropping the retry makes characters spawn genital-less.
    A successful `OnProfileApplied` must **clear the pending entry**: mobs get a default
    genital-less profile event during `ComponentInit` before the real profile arrives, and a stale
    pending entry re-syncs on the next tick and wipes the configured organs (regression test:
    `StalePendingProfileDoesNotWipeGenitals`).

## 14. Configuration defaults differ from upstream

- `game.defaultpreset = "nfpirate"`, `game.map = "Frontier"`, `game.map_pool = "NFMapPool"`.
- Upstream game presets have `rules: []` — Traitor/Nukeops/Wizard are inert by default.
- `audio.lobby_music_collection` default was changed from `NFLobbyMusic` to `PSLobbyMusic`.
- `game.destination_file` triggers a one-shot data dump and shuts the server down.

## 15. State/global mutable traps

- `IoCManager` is per-thread; systems/managers are process singletons, not per round. Reset
  round-scoped state on `RoundRestartCleanupEvent`.
- `ServerPreferencesManager` caches profiles per user.
- `GameTicker` is a large partial class; prefer a system + rule over adding cross-concern logic.
- Prototype reloads mutate live entities; handlers must be idempotent.

## 16. Content-authoring hazards (carried over from the old docs)

- **Species Head/Chest base sprites require sex-morph variants** (`HeadMale`/`HeadFemale`/
  `TorsoMale`/`TorsoFemale`) or they render wrong/invisible.
- **`MarkingPoints.Required` is effectively unused.**
- **Dungeon rooms are copied by prototype ID only** — atlas entity DataFields are lost.
- **Salvage-magnet asteroid configs are commented out** while code still references them; only debris
  offers work.
- **`RandomHumanoidSpawner` markers self-delete on MapInit** — one-shot.
- **Admin permission cache is built once** in `AdminManager.Initialize()`; commands registered later
  become server-console-only for players.
- **Engine `savegrid`/`savemap` are server-console-only** and write to `data/`, never `Resources/`.

## 17. Stray repository artifacts

- `identifier.sqlite` — 0-byte tracked file at repo root, referenced nowhere.
- `Resources/manifest.yml` window title/logo may not match Palmtree branding.

## 18. Runtime-loaded maps and server popups (Hilbert's Hotel / SS13 port findings)

- **`SharedPopupSystem.PopupClient` is a no-op on the server** — it exists for client-side
  prediction. Server code must use `PopupEntity(message, entity, recipient)` or the popup silently
  never appears (all hotel popups were invisible until this was fixed).
- **Never pause a runtime-loaded map with a player body on it.** `SetPaused(map, true)` also sets
  `EntityPaused` on the body; an admin ghost returning to a paused room froze the player. Keep maps
  live and delete them after a grace period instead.
- **`GravityComponent.Enabled` defaults to `false`.** Generated maps must set
  `Gravity: enabled: true, inherent: true` or players float.
- **Machines default to requiring APC power.** Runtime rooms have no power grid; emit
  `ApcPowerReceiver: needsPower: false` (resolve inheritance through prototype parents) or use
  `AlwaysPowered*` prototypes.
- **Props are unanchored unless their prototype is a structure.** Map generators should emit
  `anchored: True` on every placed prop.
- **`MapLoaderSystem.TryLoadMap` returns a paused, uninitialized map.** Call
  `SharedMapSystem.InitializeMap` yourself; do not pass `InitializeMaps = true` and then call it
  again (it throws).
- **YAMLLinter does not validate map files.** Missing or abstract prototypes only fail at load
  ("Missing prototype for map: X"); integration tests that load every map are the gate.
- **`savemap` writes to the server user-data dir** (`bin/Content.Server/data`) and map loading
  prefers user data over `Resources` ("Reading map user data instead of content"). Copy saved files
  back and delete stale user-data copies.
- **Rotating a `noRot` entity in a map file** triggers a load-time `DebugAssertException`.
- Full method and SS13 concept mapping: `.ai/guides/porting-from-ss13.md`.

## 19. Fork port batch hazards (2026-10)

- **Never run a blind word replacement over locale files.** Renaming "spesos" also rewrote FTL
  placeables (`{$spesos}` became `{$space roubles}`) and message keys
  (`forensic-reward-amount-speso-only`); the client then crashes at startup with a Fluent parse
  error. Always grep for `$` placeables and `^key` after bulk edits, and run the YAMLLinter (which
  boots a client and parses every `.ftl`).
- **Commenting out every child of an `entityTable` leaves `children:` null** and crashes prototype
  deserialization (`NullNotAllowedException`). Use `table: !type:NoneSelector` instead.
- **`EmoteCategory` is now a `ushort` flag set.** Emotes in species categories (Vulp, Felinid, ...)
  do not carry the `Vocal` flag, so `HasFlag(EmoteCategory.Vocal)` checks in muting/mumble systems
  no longer match them — this matches Coyote and is intentional, but new code should not assume
  "vocal emote" means `Vocal` flag only (`EmoteCategory.Sex` is `Vocal|Hands`).
- **DB changes need both migrations.** After editing `Content.Server.Database/Model.cs`, run
  `dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --context SqliteServerDbContext|PostgresServerDbContext
  --project Content.Server.Database --startup-project Content.Server.Database` (the design-time
  factories live in the DB project); commit the migration, designer and snapshot files.
- **Integration tests must `await pair.CleanReturnAsync()`** or the pair is dirty-disposed and the
  test is reported as skipped, not failed.
- **`_DV/Recipes/Lathes/misc.yml` already existed** (CassetteTape/TapeRecorder recipes); adding the
  water vapor tank recipe required appending, not overwriting (the lathe packs reference those ids).

## 20. BYOND gun sprites and `MagazineVisuals` (2026-10)

- **BYOND encodes ammo/bolt in the `icon_state` name**: `<name>[-<max_ammo>][-e][-f]` plus `_open`
  hand sprites (`-e` = no chambered round, `-<max_ammo>` = magazine attached, `-f` = folded stock).
  Examples: `rpd` (drum, chambered), `rpd-e` (open/empty), `rpd-100`, `uzi-30`, `M38closed80`.
  World art lives in `icons/fallout/objects/guns/{ballistic,bar,ammo}.dmi` and
  `modular_coyote/icons/objects/{automatic,mgs,rifles}.dmi` (the `gen_guns.py` port script is not
  in this repo). Parse sheet states with `state = "([^"]+)"\s*\n\s*dirs = (\d+)...`.
- **The port cropped instead of scaling.** `bar.dmi` is 40x32, the `.rsi` frame is 32x32, so the
  generator chopped the barrel off (BAR "kinda broken"). When a source is wider than the frame,
  resize the `.rsi` `size` (and pad the 32x32 inhand/equipped cells symmetrically so the center - and
  the held position - does not shift).
- **`MagazineVisuals` mapping**: `base`/`bolt-open` must use the *magazine-less* states, the
  `mag-N` overlay uses the *with-magazine* states, and `zeroVisible: false` unless `mag-0` really
  draws an empty magazine. A child prototype can add `- type: MagazineVisuals` with its own
  `steps`/`zeroVisible` (fields merge). If `base` has the mag and `bolt-open` does not, the magazine
  only appears when the player racks the gun (RPD bug); if the `mag-0` art is blank the gun never
  shows a magazine at all even with `zeroVisible: true`.
