# Idea: Coyote Bayou (BYOND) weapon port backlog

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Proposed — not implemented (backlog / reference list) |
| **Scope** | Port backlog of Fallout-themed guns from the `coyote-bayou` BYOND checkout into this repo (proposed `_CS` prefix, see §5) |
| **Touched areas** | `Resources/Prototypes/_CS/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Fallout/*`, `Resources/Textures/_CS/Objects/Weapons/Guns/*`, `Resources/Audio/_CS/Weapons/Fallout/*` (all to be created), `.ai/PORTING.md`, `.ai/file_paths.md` |
| **Source** | `BYOND/coyote-bayou` — Fallout-themed SS13 codebase ("Fox": Citadel -> Desert Rose -> Fortuna -> The Wasteland -> Sunset Wasteland -> Fox). Not yet listed in `.ai/file_paths.md` |
| **Research anchors** | `code/modules/projectiles/guns/**`, `modular_coyote/code/modules/znuguns/**`, `modular_sand/**`, `modular_citadel/**` |

This file parks the full scan of the coyote-bayou gun catalogue: **480 guns we do not have** (after removing templates, debug/test/toy/magic entries and the overlap we already cover), grouped by category. The maintainer judged the list too large to port in one go; §5 sketches the port plan and the decisions needed before any implementation starts.

---

## 1. Summary

- The raw scan found ~630 named gun types; after filtering and removing our existing coverage, **480 distinct guns remain** as the backlog.
- We already cover only a small overlap (see §2), so almost the whole Fallout arsenal is missing.
- The `modular_coyote` **znuguns** pack (`modular_coyote/code/modules/znuguns/code/guns/tier0-3.dm`) is a **balance overlay** over the same guns (`damage_multiplier = TIER0..3`), not a separate set — port each gun once with SS14-appropriate stats, not the tier multipliers.
- Sprites and sounds are available in the source: see §4.

## 2. What we already cover (excluded from the lists below)

energy gun, disabler, taser gun, tesla gun, pulse rifle, pulse carbine, pulse pistol, temperature gun, x-ray laser gun, antique laser gun, laser carbine, proto-kinetic accelerator, syringe gun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, WT-550 PDW, WT-550 Sporting Carbine, Mosin-Nagant m38, Hristov, AK-47, flintlock pistol, musket, laser tag gun, practice laser gun, classic pump-action shotgun, Luger P08, CX Model D Energy Gun.

## 4. Assets available in the source

- Gun icons: `icons/fallout/objects/guns/ballistic.dmi` (750 states), `energy.dmi` (482), `longguns.dmi`, `ammo.dmi` (651); `modular_coyote/icons/objects/{automatic,pistols,ancient,rifles,c13ammo}.dmi`; `modular_citadel/icons/obj/guns/*`.
- Inhand/onmob: `icons/fallout/onmob/weapons/guns_lefthand.dmi` / `guns_righthand.dmi` (229/231 states, per-gun) and `64x64_*` for the big guns.
- Audio: 108 `.ogg` files in `sound/f13weapons/` (fire/reload per gun).
- Ammo/magazine sprites exist for the native calibers (see §5.2) if new calibers are ever added.

## 5. Port plan sketch (decisions needed)

### 5.1 Conventions
- Prefix: `_CS` (matches the coyote-bayou clothes already ported with `copyright: coyote-bayou`); prototypes `_CS/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Fallout/...`, textures `_CS/Objects/Weapons/Guns/...`, audio `_CS/Weapons/Fallout/...`. Alternative: `_PS` if a clean split from the Coyote SS14 content is preferred.
- Prototypes: reuse NF base frames/chambers (`NFBaseWeaponPistolChamber45`, `...SMGChamber35`, `...RifleChamber20/30/60`, `...ShotgunChamber50`, `...RevolverChamber45`), per-gun `Gun` stats and fire modes from the `.dm` (semi/burst/auto, fire rates, burst size), `ItemSlots` mag whitelists, `MagazineVisuals`, `NFWeaponDetails`, `StaticPrice`.
- Sprites: DMI -> RSI with the zTXt/Pillow method from `.ai/guides/porting-from-ss13.md` (frame-major, direction-minor S/N/E/W; `meta.json` credit `coyote-bayou`, CC-BY-SA-3.0).

### 5.2 Caliber mapping (recommended: map to existing NF calibers)
| coyote-bayou | this repo |
|---|---|
| 9mm, .22LR, 4.7mm | .35 auto |
| 10mm, .45 ACP/LC, .44, .357, 14mm | .45 magnum |
| 5.56x45/.223 | .20 rifle |
| 7.62x39, 7.62x51/.308, .30-06 | .30 rifle |
| anti-materiel (Boys / AMR) | .60 |
| 12 gauge | .50 shells |
| 5mm | .20 rifle (or .10 for miniguns) |
| needler / plasma / laser / MFC | energy + new `_CS` projectiles (no caliber) |

Adding native 10mm/.44/.357/5.56/7.62 calibers is the fidelity option but needs cartridges, boxes, magazines, projectiles, tags, loot and sprites for each — much larger than the mapping above.

### 5.3 Suggested phases
1. **Iconic Fallout set (~25)**: AER9/AER12/AER14/LAER, Wattz 1000/2000, AEP7, Solar Scorcher, RCW, plasma pistol/rifle/carbine/Multiplas/Glock 86/Caster, Gamma gun, alien blaster, Tesla cannon, pulse destroyer; 10mm pistol, M1911, N99, Desert Eagle, .44 revolver, cowboy repeater, hunting rifle, R91, assault carbine, marksman carbine, service rifle, M1 Garand, SKS, BAR, combat/trench/hunting shotgun, Auto-5, Pancor Jackhammer, Fatman, CZ53 minigun, pipe rifle, laser/plasma musket.
2. Remaining ballistic (pistols/revolvers/SMGs/rifles/LMGs, needlers, exotic calibers).
3. Hobo/craftable, flintlock/matchlock, bows, launchers, misc.
4. `modular_sand` / `modular_citadel` oddities (AM4, flechette, spinfusor, pump-action particle blaster, size ray, goat gun).

### 5.4 Per-gun checklist
read the `.dm` -> map caliber/fire modes -> extract sprites (+ sounds) -> write the prototype -> wire acquisition (vendor / dungeon case) -> changelog + `.ai/PORTING.md` -> validate (build, YAMLLinter, tests, headless, RSI layout check).

### 5.5 Open decisions
1. Scope: curated Phase 1 (~25) or the whole catalogue in batches?
2. Prefix `_CS` vs `_PS`.
3. Calibers: map to existing (recommended) vs add native 10mm et al.
4. Audio: port `sound/f13weapons` (licensing caveat: Fallout-derived audio) or skip.
5. Magazines: reuse shared NF mags (recommended) vs per-gun mags for capacity fidelity.

## 6. How this list was generated
Scanned every `.dm` under the `coyote-bayou` checkout for top-level `/obj/item/gun/...` type declarations and their explicit `name = "..."`, deduped by type path and then by name across categories, dropped templates / debug / test / cyborg / mounted / toy / practice entries and the names in §2, then grouped by source file. Re-run the scan if the source checkout is updated.
