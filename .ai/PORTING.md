# PORTING — Coyote/Floof → Palmtree (Frontier)

> This document records what was ported from the old `coyote-frontier` checkout into this repository,
> what was deliberately left out, why, and how to port more. The earlier full-merge attempt and its
> audit folder were deleted by the maintainer; this document is the surviving decision history.

## 1. Background

- Old base: the Coyote checkout (`COYOTE`, see `.ai/file_paths.md`; branch `palm3`), fork chain Wizden → Frontier → Coyote (`_CS`) →
  Palmtree (`_PS`). Frozen since Coyote was abandoned in 2026.
- New base: this repo, Frontier Station @ 2026-10-03 (`df24c19f08`) + Palmtree branch `ps-erp`
  (merged into `master`, branch deleted).
- An earlier attempt merged the **entire** Coyote tree into Frontier (11,722 changed files, 1,347
  conflicts). It was discarded; the current `master` history is the only maintained line.
- The current approach is **targeted**: only the requested features are ported, using additive
  changes to Frontier code where possible, and adapting old content to 2026 APIs.

## 2. Port commits (originally on `ps-erp`)

| `8eacfa17e4` | Fix client sandbox violation (`string.Create` in `Marking.ToString`); strongly type `Layering` |
| `0acc512d11` | Fix concealable backpack implant (component on base `ClothingBackpack`, loadout group entry, tests) |
| `d4e63c28e7` | Rotate lobby background every 30s (Coyote timer patch) |
| `4f8dd74e02` | Crossfade lobby backgrounds (second `TextureRect` + smoothstep fade) |

| `afdd481c16` | Fix kind-allowed markings being stripped by `EnsureSpecies` |

## 3. What was ported

### 3.1 Marking infrastructure (`Content.Shared/Humanoid`, `Content.Client/Humanoid`)

- `Genital` + `TailBehind` + all Floof layers (`TailOversuit`, `NeckFluff`, behind-leg layers,
  `UndershirtUnderclothes`/`UndershirtOverclothes`, `TailExtras`, `Disregard`).
- `MarkingPrototype`: `kindAllowance`, `layering`, `colorLinks`, `altSprites`, `hidden`, `baseLayerSprite`.
- `Marking`: `scale`, `offsetX/Y` with backward-compatible DB string format.
- `MarkingCategories`: `Genital`, `NeckFluff`, `TailExtras`, and the Floof `Base*` categories plus
  `Category2Layer`.
- `SpeciesPrototype`: `kind`, `DefaultLegStyle`, `AllowDigilegDisplacement`.
- `HumanoidAppearanceComponent`: `HiddenBaseLayers`, `LegStyle`.
- `HumanoidCharacterAppearance`: `LegStyle` field and `WithLegs`.
- `MarkingPicker`: advanced size/offset editor and Leg Style selector.
- Client renderer: layering routing, color links, scale/offset, genital-under-clothing ordering,
  `altSprites` swapping for base layers and markings, `HiddenBaseLayers` hiding.
- `ModifyUndies` (`Content.Server/_Floof`, `Content.Shared/_Floof`): per-marking show/hide verbs
  (`canToggleVisible` default off except undergarments, `otherCanToggleVisible` default off).

### 3.2 Content

- **Genital marking sets**: core Floof library (379), butts/bellies (19), Palmtree breasts (18) with
  sprites (`Resources/Textures/Mobs/Customization/Markings/Genital/*`, `_PS/.../Genital/breasts.rsi`)
  and locale (`_CS/genitals.ftl`, `_PS/genitals.ftl`).
- **Floof anthro markings**: ears, tails, snouts, wings, digilegs/chests, species adaptors
  (`_Floof/Entities/Mobs/Customization/markings/*` + `Floof/Mobs/Customization/*` + `_CS`/`_DV` parts).
- **Core undergarments** (218 markings, source `undergarments.yml` is a superset of Frontier's 17) and
  **underovergarments** (67).
- **Feroxi, Ovinia, Resomi, Eastern Dragon** markings with sprites and locale.
- **Tajaran** species (species/entity/player/body/markings/damage/names/sprites/locale) from `_EE`.
- **Rodentia** (`_DV`) and **Anthromorph** (`_CS`) species, adapted to Frontier 2026.
- **Coyote Bayou clothes** (`_CS/CoyoteBayouClothes/*`), including latex items
  (`CoolCoyoteClothesDomina`, `CoolCoyoteClothesLatexHalf`), wired into job loadout groups via a
  `CoyoteJumpsuit` subgroup.
- **Missing contractor loadouts/items**: `ContractorClicker` (+ `Clicker` item/audio),
  `ContractorClothingBackpackSatchelLeather`, `LoadoutFootProtectors` (+ `ClothingShoesFootProtectors`).
- **Palmtree `_PS`**: lobby backgrounds + `PSLobbyMusic` (CVar default), concealable backpack implant
  (systems/components/action/implanter/loadout), battery guns/launchers/grenades/hitscan, audio.
- **Digitigrade leg displacement** (`_CS/LegDisplacement.yml` + `LegDisplacements`), wired into
  `ClientClothingSystem` for jumpsuit/shoes/outerclothing (partial coverage, same maps as Coyote).
- **Subtle chat** (`/subtle`, `/subtlelooc`): range- and wall-limited emotes/LOOC that ghosts cannot
  see (Coyote port; `ChatTransmitRange.NoGhosts`). Also ported: `-`/`=` chat prefixes, selectable
  Subtle/Subtle LOOC channels, `FocusSubtle`/`FocusSubtleLOOCWindow` keybinds and the subtle
  notification sound option.
- **Shower** (`_HL` prefix, from Coyote's HardLight content): `Shower`/`ShowerUnfinished`, the
  `Shower` construction graph/recipe, sprite (`_HL/Structures/Furniture/shower.rsi`) and toggle
  audio (`_HL/Ambience/Shower/*`). Adaptations: the unfinished prototype inlines the `_HL` sink
  base (no sink port needed) and the plumbing construction node was dropped (this fork has no
  plumbing assembly). `Tools/convert_dmm_room.py` maps `/obj/machinery/shower` to `Shower`, so the
  converted hotel rooms include working showers.

### 3.3 Sandstorm interaction panel (2026-10, `_PS`)

- Data-driven `interaction` prototypes, organ-based genital capability detection, session consent,
  lust/moans/climax, a 3-tab XAML window (Interactions / Genital Options / Preferences),
  search/favorites/auto-repeat, Ctrl+Shift-click + verb opening, purple ERP emotes and 47 Sandstorm
  ogg sounds.
- **Genital organs**: player-configured penis/vagina/balls/breasts/butt/belly with type + size and a
  semen-per-climax amount, persisted in `Profile.Genitals` (new `genitals` column + migrations).
  Replaces genital markings; the marking library is reused as the render backend.
- **Cum**: SPLURT cum overlay (converted `cumoverlay.dmi` RSI, washable with water/space cleaner),
  `Semen` reagent, Sandstorm-style drip puddles from internal climaxes, and an `AutoCumExterior`
  preference. No pregnancy, womb, other fluids or refractory period.
- Ported from `Sandstorm-Station-13` and `S.P.L.U.R.T-Station-13` (BYOND), not Coyote; see
  `.ai/systems/interaction-panel.md` and `.ai/systems/genital-organs.md`. Tests:
  `Content.IntegrationTests/Tests/_PS/InteractionPanelTest.cs` and the `ServerDbSqliteTests`
  round-trip.

## 4. What was deliberately NOT ported

| Feature | Reason / status |
|---|---|
| Consent system (Floof UI/DB/toggles) | Maintainer decision: no consent system or DB migrations. `ModifyUndies` uses the per-marking `otherCanToggleVisible` opt-in instead (default off). See `systems/consent-and-erp.md` for how to add consent later. |
| Traits (`BodyType*`, `Horny*`, `Scent*`, 46 ids) | Tied to un-ported HornyQuirks/BodyType/Scent systems. Imports filter unknown traits out safely (`HumanoidCharacterProfile.EnsureValid`). |
| Scent / aphrodisiac visibility | Explicitly excluded. `ScentSystem`, `AphroLacedVisibility`, smell traits absent. |
| Size manipulation / height-width system | Excluded. Character saves' `height`/`width` fields are ignored on import. |
| Vore | Not ported. |
| RPI economy, Needs, Healing bank, Space janitor, etc. (`_CS`) | Not ported; not requested. |
| IPC species | Replaced by the Palmtree **Synth** species (`_PS`) — see `systems/ps-systems.md`. Old IPC content (Einstein Engines silicon stack, battery/radio/EMP) remains unported. |
| Kitsune species | **Does not exist in the old codebase.** It only appears inside marking allowlists. Nothing to port. |
| Turrets, RCD, strobe lighting, shipyard cauterizer | Not requested / possibly stale systems. (Sandstorm interaction sounds/panel were later ported — see `systems/interaction-panel.md`.) |

## 5. Bugs found and fixed during the port

These are important because they are easy to reintroduce:

1. **Sandbox violation** — `Marking.ToString()` used
   `string.Create(IFormatProvider, ref DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler)`, which is not on the
   engine's client sandbox whitelist. Replaced with `float.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)`
   concatenation. `Layering` was also changed from `Dictionary<string,string>` to
   `Dictionary<string,HumanoidVisualLayers>` to avoid runtime `Enum.Parse`.
2. **Concealable backpack did nothing** — the old repo patched base `ClothingBackpack` with a
   `ConcealableClothing` component (`toggleAction: ActionToggleConcealmentBackpack`,
   `category: backpack`). Without it no clothing could be concealed. Also added the implanter to the
   `ContractorImplanter` group.
3. **Lobby never rotated** — Coyote patched `GameTicker.LobbyBackground.cs` with a 30-second
   `Timer.SpawnRepeating(30000, CycleLobbyBackground, ...)` + `SendStatusToAll()`. Frontier only
   randomized once at startup.
4. **`MarkingsSet.EnsureDefault` overrun** — the loop condition used `||`, so a category with more
   points than `DefaultMarkings` (e.g. Rodentia's 999-point tail) indexed past the list and crashed
   entity spawning. Fixed to `&&`.
5. **Kind-shared markings stripped** — `MarkingsSet.EnsureSpecies` filtered with
   `SpeciesRestrictions.Contains(species)` only, removing markings allowed through `kindAllowance`
   (e.g. `FeroxiTorsoCountershadingF` on a Vulpkanin). Fixed to use
   `MarkingManager.IsAllowedBySpeciesOrKindAllowance`.
6. **Stale YAMLLinter assemblies** — running `Content.YAMLLinter --no-build` after C# changes used
   old `Content.Shared.dll` copies, producing bogus "value not found" enum errors. Always rebuild
   before linting.

## 6. IPC replacement: Synth (implemented)

IPC was held back because the old implementation (`_EinsteinEngines`) needs the EE silicon stack:
`Silicon`, `BatterySlotRequiresLock`, `EncryptionHolderRequiresLock`, `SiliconEmitSoundOnDrained`,
`EmitBuzzWhileDamaged`, `DeadStartupButton`, `EncryptionKeyHolder`, `BatteryDrinker`, the `ipc`
inventory template, and silicon body parts/organs.

Instead, Palmtree implemented a replacement species, **Synth** (`_PS`), which reuses the marking
system so players can look like any species and approximates IPC behavior: 1.5× speed, 3× durability,
IPC-like damage container/modifier set, silicon body parts/organs (IPC sprites, `Inorganic` parts),
coolant blood, robot typing indicator, insulated temperature, heavy fixture density, no
hunger/thirst, and mass-based pull slowdown. See `.ai/systems/ps-systems.md` for details and known
differences (no battery, no radio/encryption, no EMP interactions).

If a true silicon implementation is ever wanted, build it on the upstream/engine silicon & borg
systems already in this repo (`Content.Server/Silicons`, `Content.Shared/Silicons`) instead of
importing the EE stack.

## 7. Character saves compatibility

The maintainer's exported characters live outside the repo
(`~/Documents/SS14/Characters`). Facts established while porting:

- Import path: client `HumanoidAppearanceSystem.FromStream` → `HumanoidProfileExport` →
  `HumanoidCharacterProfile.EnsureValid`.
- Unknown fields in the YAML (e.g. `height`, `width`, old Floof marking fields like `glowLevels`,
  `takeOffVerb2p`, `customName`) are ignored by the serializer.
- Unknown prototypes (traits, markings, loadouts) are filtered by `EnsureValid`/`EnsureSpecies`
  rather than failing the import.
- After the port, all 114 markings, 166 loadouts/items and all species referenced by those saves
  resolve except IPC.
- `legStyle: Digitigrade` is now imported and honored.
- **Unknown species fallback**: `FromStream` maps exports whose species no longer exists to `Synth`
  (if present) or the default species, so old IPC saves import cleanly and can be switched to Synth
  in the editor.

## 8. How to port more (short version)

See `.ai/guides/porting-from-coyote.md` for the full method. In short:

1. Find the source files in the Coyote checkout (`COYOTE`, see `.ai/file_paths.md`) by prototype ID or feature name.
2. Classify each field/component against this repo (`grep` the C# type / prototype type).
3. Copy content files and assets; adapt fields that do not exist here (remove or rewrite).
4. Wire loadouts/groups/locale; keep prefixes for provenance.
5. Rebuild the solution, rebuild `Content.YAMLLinter`, run it; then run relevant tests.
6. Commit with a note about adaptations; update `.ai/PORTING.md` and `.ai/HAZARDS.md` if you learn
   something new.

For **SS13 (BYOND) content** — features from the `BYOND` checkouts (see `.ai/file_paths.md`),
`.dmm` room maps and `.dmi` art — use `.ai/guides/porting-from-ss13.md` instead. It covers the TGM
`.dmm` format, the `Tools/convert_dmm_room.py` generator, format-7 map requirements (air, gravity,
power, anchoring), SS13→SS14 concept mapping and the related hazards.

## 9. 2026-10 feature batch (Coyote ports + Palmtree systems)

Ports from the `COYOTE` checkout (see `.ai/file_paths.md`):

- **Feroxi species** (`_DV/Species`, `_DV/Body/{Parts,Organs,Prototypes}`, `_DV/Entities/Mobs`,
  `_DV/Damage/modifier_sets.yml`, `_DV/Chemistry/metabolizer_types.yml`, `_DV/SoundCollections/feroxi.yml`,
  `_DV/Voice/*`, `_DV/typing_indicator.yml`, guidebook XML). Coyote's unused `FeroxiDehydrate`
  component and the RPI `Needs` system were dropped (not ported here); Hunger/Thirst are used instead.
  The body prototype uses `OrganFeroxiLungs` (Coyote's used human lungs and only had the metabolizer
  type on the unused organ) so Feroxi can breathe **water vapor and oxygen**:
  `Water` reagent `Gas` metabolism got the Feroxi `Oxygenate`/`SatiateThirst`/`ModifyLungGas` effects
  and `Oxygen` got a Feroxi `Oxygenate`.
- **Water vapor tanks** (`_DV/Entities/Objects/Tools/gas_tank.yml`,
  `_DV/Catalog/Fills/Items/gas_tanks.yml`, `_DV/Recipes/Lathes/misc.yml` + `DeltaV/Objects/Tanks/*.rsi`,
  tank dispenser inventory entries). Coyote's water-vapor survival boxes were skipped (they reference
  unported food/medipens).
- **Emotes + emote picker**: see `.ai/systems/ps-systems.md` for the system map. Content files were
  copied from `Floof/`, `_EinsteinEngines/`, `_PS/`, `_DEN/`, `_Funkystation/` and `_CS/` into the
  matching `_Floof`/`_EE`/`_PS`/`_DEN`/`_Funkystation`/`_CS` folders. `Whine` was kept and Coyote's
  separate `Whimper` emote was added next to it. The deathgasp was fixed: `DefaultDeathgasp` has its
  `deathgasp` chat triggers back (organic message + species sound), `SiliconDeathgasp` is named
  "Silicon Deathgasp", categorized `Borg` and whitelisted to `BorgChassis`/`Synth`, and both borgs
  and the Synth species use it as their on-death gasp.
- **Glass gas mask** (SS13 Skyrat/SPLURT `/obj/item/clothing/mask/gas/glass`): prototype
  `_PS/Clothing/Mask/glass_gas_mask.yml` + RSI extracted from the SS13 `.dmi` (`gas_clear`). It has no
  `IdentityBlocker`/`HideLayerClothing`, so the face/snout stays visible, and is a contractor face
  loadout. Species worn variants were extracted from Skyrat's `mask_muzzled.dmi` and `species/vox/mask.dmi`
  (`equipped-MASK-vulpkanin`/`felinid`/`rodentia`/`feroxi`/`harpy`/`reptilian` use the muzzled sprite,
  `equipped-MASK-vox` the vox one); the client picks these up from `InventoryComponent.SpeciesId`, no C#.
- **Custom species name** (profile field, DB column, editor field, examine/records use).
  Coyote's `SpeciesPrototype.CustomName` gated the feature but no species set it, so it never saved;
  here the default is `true` (all round-start species allow it).
- **Emote category picker** (profile field + DB column, `EmoteCategoryWindow`, wheel filtering,
  `EmoteCategory` enum widened to Coyote's `ushort` set, `ShowInWheel`, supplemental emote sounds).
  Server-side emote restrictions were disabled (Coyote behavior); the picker controls visibility.

Palmtree-original changes in the same batch: currency renamed to "space roubles" (ids unchanged),
fuel scaling for longer rounds (~2.7x the original durations), pest/power station events disabled, forensic swab 0.5 s,
SSD bodies don't suffocate, admin playtime-only bypass, `exportcharacters` console command,
Palmtree splash logo, non-`_PS` lobby backgrounds/music disabled.

## 10. 2026-10 marking port batch (Coyote)

- **Cybernetic markings** (`_EE/Entities/Mobs/Customization/`): all seven shell sets (bishop,
  hephiastos, morpheus, shellguard, wardtakahashi, xion, zenghu) + `Resources/Textures/_EE/Mobs/Species/Cybernetics/*`.
  Coyote lists them as `speciesRestriction: [IPC]` (no IPC here), but every marking carries
  `kindAllowance: [BasicHumanlike, BasicFurry]`, and `IsAllowedBySpeciesOrKindAllowance` allows a
  kind match even when the species restriction does not, so the **Synth** species (kind includes
  `BasicRobot`/`BasicHumanlike`/`BasicFurry`) can use all heads/chests/limbs. Organics with matching
  kinds can use the limb sets (arms/legs/hands/feet).
- **Robot antennae + screen faces** (`_EE/.../antenna.yml`, `screens.yml` + `_EE/Mobs/Customization/ipc_antenna.rsi`,
  `ipc_screens.rsi`): same kind-allowance sharing, usable by Synth.
- **Tail/wing/hair marking sets**: `_CS/aggie_tails.yml` (Kemono tails), `_CS/.../Markings/tail_adapters.yml`
  (hidden digitigrade vulp tails, used through `altSprites`), `_CS/.../Markings/wings.yml` (draconic/fairy
  wings), `_CS/.../Markings/anthro_tails.yml` (Aussie Shepherd tail + wag), `_DV/.../Markings/hairextensions.yml`
  (91 hairstyles, `_CS/Hairmarkings/*`), `_Starlight` Avali/Resomi sets (parts, crests, eyes, jewelry,
  hair, gauze, tails) and Avali/Resomi undergarments, `_DV`/`_NF` chitinid sets. All sprites copied.
- **Adaptations**: Coyote's `waggingId`/`staticId` marking fields were stripped (its modified
  wag-toggle `WaggingSystem` is not ported; this fork keeps the older "Animated"-suffix system and the
  separate `*Wag` markings are selected manually). Vulp tail markings got `altSprites → DigiVulpTail*`
  so digitigrade swaps tails too.
- **Digitigrade fixes**: Anthromorph and Reptilian base sprites got `altSprites`; the shared organic
  base layer list got the behind-leg layers; Reptilian got the behind-layer `speciesBaseSprites`
  entries. See `.ai/systems/marking-and-appearance.md`.
- **Slime batch**: water weakness + confirm suppression + death revert; see
  `.ai/systems/ps-systems.md` ("Slime transformation").

## 11. 2026-10 species + marking locale batch

- **Marking locale**: the 13 Coyote FTL files for the previously ported marking sets
  (`_EE/silicons/cyberlimbs.ftl`, `_EE/.../ipcAntenna.ftl`/`ipcScreens.ftl`,
  `_Starlight/markings/{avali,avali_tattoos,gauze_resomi,tattoos_resomi,undergarments}.ftl`,
  `_Starlight/accessories/{avali-crest,resomi-hair}.ftl`, `_DV/markings/chitinid.ftl`,
  `_NF/markings/chitinid.ftl`, `_CS/markings.ftl`). Without them every marking name rendered as
  its raw id.
- **Species ports** (from Coyote, same file layout as `.ai/guides/adding-species.md`):
  - **Chitinid** (`_DV`): species/body/parts/organs/player/names, `Chitinid` radiation-absorbing
    C# (`Content.Server/_DV/Abilities/Chitinid`), the `Chitzite` item + `ActionChitzite` (uses the
    already-ported `ItemCougherSystem`). Adaptations: `Needs` → `Hunger`/`Thirst` (33% faster),
    `AphrodisiacDrinks` metabolizer group dropped (not ported), custom Sprite layer block dropped,
    `chitinid0/1` typing states merged into `_DV/Effects/speech.rsi`.
  - **Ovinia** (`_DEN`): species/body/parts/mob/player (Coyote keeps the player mob under `_DV`),
    sound collections + baa/moo audio, `OviniaEmotes` tag + emote whitelists, typing indicator,
    damage set. `minHeight`/`maxHeight` removed, `Needs` dropped, custom Sprite dropped.
  - **Avali + Resomi** (`_Starlight`): species/bodies/organs/mobs/players/dummies, names, voice,
    sound collections, tags, inventories, metabolizer types (`Avali`/`Resomi`), Avali blood reagents
    (`AvaliBlood`/`ResomiBlood`) and `Amoxla`. Dropped: the Coyote `Stasis`/Nanite Shell actions and
    the Mono `FoodMeatResomi` (uses `FoodMeatHuman`). `Needs` → `Hunger`/`Thirst` (Avali 2x).
  - **Avali core reagent conditions** (ported into the shared reagent files): Ammonia heals Avali
    asphyxiation and is otherwise harmless to them, Iron poisons them, Dexalin/Dexalin+ are lethal
    to them, Saline burns them, and the DeltaV Feroxi saline nerf was ported in the same pass.
- **Every species now has a guidebook entry**: added index entries and XMLs for Feroxi, Rodentia,
  Tajaran and Anthromorph (from Coyote), new pages for Synth/Gingerbread/Skeleton, and the four new
  species' pages; the Species overview embeds all of them.
- **Survival boxes**: all ported species were added to the `OxygenBreather` loadout effect group -
  previously Vulpkanin/Felinid/etc. failed the species check and spawned without a survival box.
- **Shared organic layer list**: `UndershirtUnderclothes` and `clownedon` were added to the
  `BaseMobSpeciesOrganic` sprite layer list (the first block and custom species already had them),
  so base-list species render those layers in the right order.
- **Slime water rebalance** and the `SlimeWaterContactSystem`: see `.ai/systems/ps-systems.md`.

## 12. 2026-10 feature batch (PDA IFF, Shortband, crit speech)

- **PDA IFF blips (Coyote)**: `_CS/BlipCartridge` (`BlipCartridgeComponent`,
  `BlipColorSetPrototype`, `BlipShapeSetPrototype`, `RadarBlipPresetPrototype`, server
  `BlipCartridgeSystem`) plus the `_CS/Blipz` prototypes. Every PDA inherits `BlipCartridge` from
  `BasePDA` with per-department presets; admin PDAs are disabled. It reuses the existing `_NF`
  radar-blip pipeline: `RadarBlipShape` gained `Heart`, `X`, `CircleWithLine` and the client
  `ShuttleNavControl` draws the X and geometric heart shapes. Pocket PDAs appear as customizable
  blips on mass scanners / shuttle consoles (verbs: preset, colour, shape, size, toggle).
- **Shortband radio (Coyote "Traffic" replacement)**: `RadioChannelPrototype` gained the range
  degradation fields; `RadioSystem.MangleRadioMessage` / `MangleMessage` / `GenerifyName` rebuild a
  degraded message, with hooks in `RadioSystem.OnIntrinsicReceive`, `HeadsetSystem`,
  `RadioDeviceSystem` and `_NF/HandheldRadioSystem`. `Traffic` keeps its id/frequency but displays
  as "Shortband" and degrades with distance (650 m optimal, static-glyph text beyond, 50% drop past
  the heavy range). The `_CS/RadioNoises` static-sound system (component, prototype, system and
  `Resources/Audio/_CS/RadioStatic`) is attached to headsets, handheld radios and intercoms, with
  squelch/volume verbs.
- **Speech in crit (Coyote)**: `MobStateSystem` only cancels `SpeakAttemptEvent` and
  `EmoteAttemptEvent` while dead; critical mobs can talk and emote. The one-shot
  `AllowNextCritSpeechComponent` is still consumed by `SleepingSystem` but no longer by
  `MobStateSystem`.
- **Housekeeping**: solar flare and bluespace cargo events are disabled in the NF and upstream
  calm-event tables; slime base sprites gained the missing marking layers (`Tail`, `HeadTop`,
  `HeadSide`, `Snout`, `Special`, `NeckFluff`, `RArmExtension`); the synthesizer now carries
  Coyote's full 128-program General MIDI list.

## 13. 2026-10 Sandstorm clothing batch (Soviet set, RD beret, admiral jumpsuit)

- **DMI conversion verified**: extraction follows the BYOND cell layout (row-major grid,
  `dimX = width / 32`; each state consumes `dirs * frames` cells frame-major/dir-minor) and was
  diffed pixel-for-pixel against DMISharp. Method and pitfalls: `.ai/guides/porting-from-ss13.md`
  §5. Source: `Sandstorm-Station-13`
  (`icons/obj|mob/clothing/{uniforms,uniform,suits,suit,hats,head}.dmi`).
- **Soviet set (`_PS`)**: `ClothingUniformJumpsuitSoviet` (state `soviet`),
  `ClothingUniformJumpsuitSovietConscript` (state `soviet_uniform`) and
  `ClothingOuterCoatSoviet` (state `soviet_suit`); RSIs under
  `Resources/Textures/_PS/Clothing/{Uniforms/Jumpsuit,OuterClothing/Coats}`. The ushanka already
  existed upstream. Sprites are CC-BY-SA-3.0 (tg/DonkSoft set via Sandstorm).
- **Research Director's beret (`_PS`)**: `ClothingHeadHatBeretResearchDirector` (state `rdberet`),
  wired into `LockerFillResearchDirectorNoHardsuit` (so both RD lockers spawn it).
- **CentComm admiral jumpsuit**: Skyrat asset `centcom_admiral.rsi` copied from Coyote under
  `_Starlight`; prototype `ClothingUniformJumpsuitCentcomAdmiral` in the `_Starlight` jumpsuits
  file. Admin spawn only - no loadout/lathe/vendor entry.

## 14. 2026-10 AKM port (Coyote `_CS` weapons)

- **AKM (`CSWeaponAssaultRifleAKM`, `_CS`)**: prototype in
  `Resources/Prototypes/_CS/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Rifles/rifles_assault.yml` (NF .30
  assault rifle chamber + Cybersun frame), RSI
  `Resources/Textures/_CS/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Rifles/akm.rsi` (CC-BY-SA-3.0, CEV-Eris/Frontier)
  and Mono gunshot `Resources/Audio/_Mono/Weapons/Guns/SmallArms/Gunshots/ak_fire.ogg`.
  Obtainable exactly like Coyote: `WeaponCaseLongAkm` dungeon case
  (`_CS/Catalog/Fills/Items/weapon_cases_expedition.yml`), `MailCSAK` (`_CS/Mail/mail.yml`) added
  to `RandomNFMailDeliveryPool` at 0.1, and the T3 ranged dungeon weapon table
  (`_NF/Entities/Markers/Spawners/Random/Items/weapon_tables.yml`).
- **Pending Coyote `_CS` weapons** (not ported yet):
  - **`.40` heavy pistol conversion suite (`_CS/HeavyPistols` + `Ammunition/*/pistol.yml`)**:
    frames/chambers, cartridges, boxes, magazines and projectiles. Coyote uses these to convert
    `NFWeaponPistolViper`, the Universal/NFSD Universal variants and the tiered heavy pistols to
    `.40`; this fork still ships them on the Frontier `.35` chambers. The suite also brings
    `WeaponCaseShortAmmoBox*40` cases and `WeaponCaseHeavyAmmo`. (Only the heavy pistol *frames*
    are ported, for the Anaconda - the chambers/ammo are not.)
  - **Size manipulator (`WeaponSizeManipulator`)**: blocked - depends on Coyote's size system and
    `BulletSizeManipulator*` projectiles, and the size system is not ported (`.ai/UNKNOWN.md` #8).

## 15. 2026-10 Weapon batch: re-enabled Frontier guns, practice ammo, Coyote ports

- **Frontier-disabled upstream guns.** Frontier removes whole upstream weapon directories at load
  through `Resources/IgnoredPrototypes/ignoredPrototypes.yml` (`Battery`, `HMGs`, `Rifles`,
  `Pistols`, `Revolvers`, `Shotguns`, `SMGs`, `Snipers`, plus the ammunition directories), so
  individual prototypes cannot be re-enabled in place - their IDs stay reserved but the prototypes
  are gone. Guns that had no enabled Frontier replacement were copied into `_PS` with `PS` ids and
  the original stats/sprites (all CC-BY-SA-3.0 upstream assets):
  - `PSWeaponTaser` + `PSWeaponTaserSuper` (elite taser) - `_PS/.../Battery/reenabled_upstream_guns.yml`
  - `PSWeaponTeslaGun`, `PSWeaponEnergyShotgun` (fire modes restored with `_PS` spread projectiles)
  - `PSWeaponMinigun` (+ `PSCartridgeMinigun`/`PSBulletMinigun`, the upstream .10 cartridge was
    disabled in place by Frontier) - `_PS/.../HMGs/minigun.yml`
  - `PSWeaponRifleAk` (the WizDen AKMS, magazine whitelist switched to the `NFMagazineRifle30`/
    `NFCartridgeRifle30` tags) - `_PS/.../Rifles/akms.yml`
  - Projectiles needed by the above live in
    `_PS/.../Ammunition/Projectiles/reenabled_upstream_projectiles.yml`; the wizard "Summon Guns"
    pool (`Magic/event_spells.yml`) got `PSWeaponTaser`, `PSWeaponTeslaGun`,
    `PSWeaponEnergyShotgun`, `PSWeaponMinigun` and the previously commented
    `WeaponTetherGun`/`WeaponForceGun` back.
  - Pulse pistol/carbine/rifle, laser cannon, x-ray cannon, advanced/antique laser, particle
    decelerator and the revolver/SMG/shotgun/sniper families were **not** copied: Frontier already
    ships rebalanced enabled versions (`NFWeaponEnergyPistolPulse`, `NFWeaponEnergyRiflePulse`,
    `NFWeaponEnergyRifleAssaultPulseCarbine`, `NFWeaponEnergyRifleSniperCannon`,
    `NFWeaponEnergyRifleSniperXrayCannon`, `NFWeaponEnergyPistolLaserAdvanced`,
    `NFWeaponEnergyPistolLaserAntique`, `NFWeaponParticleDecelerator`, ...).
- **Practice ammo re-enabled** (Frontier removed it in #4608): the commented practice cases
  (`WeaponCaseShortAmmoBoxPractice{20,25,30,35,45,Shotgun}`), crates
  (`CrateAmmoBoxPractice*`), the `TableDungeonLootWeaponsAmmunitionPractice` table and the
  `SpawnDungeonLootAmmoPractice` marker were un-commented in place; the practice table is nested
  into `TableDungeonLootWeaponsAmmunition` (weight 0.05) and the crates into the mercenary T5
  crate group.
- **Prototype pulse rifle (`WeaponPrototypePulseRifle`, `_PS`)**: ported from Coyote (Floof),
  sprite `_PS/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Battery/prototype_pulse_rifle.rsi`, hitscan `PulseWeak` in the
  `_PS` hitscan file, case `WeaponCaseLongPrototypePulseRifleExpedition` (T5 dungeon loot) and the
  `FloofBlueprintWeaponLaserPrototypePulseRifle` blueprint (`_PS` blueprint + lathe recipe
  `WeaponPrototypePulseLaser`) added to the expedition document case table.
- **EG-4 energy revolver (`WeaponEnergyRevolver`, `_PS`)**: ported from Coyote (Goobstation),
  sprite `_PS/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Battery/erevolver.rsi`, `BulletEnergyGunMagnum` projectile,
  case `WeaponCaseShortEnergyRevolverExpedition` (T4 dungeon loot) and the
  `UplinkSecurityEnergyRevolver` NFSD uplink listing (`_PS/Catalog/security_uplink_catalog.yml`).
- **Anaconda (`WeaponPistolAnaconda` + `CSWeaponPistolAnacondaExpedition`)**: ported from Coyote
  (`_Goobstation` pistol + `BulletAnaconda` cartridge-wrapper projectile, `_CS` expedition variant
  and case). Needs the `_CS` heavy pistol **frames** (ported in
  `_CS/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Guns/HeavyPistols/base_pistol.yml`; the .40 chambers are not) and
  the new `weapon-details-class-heavy-pistol` locale string. Case in T4 dungeon loot.
- **Lollypop dispensers (`LauncherLollypopRegenerating` + Tricordazine/Omnizine/Weh/Mystery)**
  and the whole lollypop food set: copied from Coyote (`_Goobstation` food + pneumatic cannon
  files, `_Goobstation/.../lollypop.rsi`). Admin/DoNotMap content.
- **C-19r SMG (`CSWeaponSubMachineGunC19r`, `_CS`)**: ported from Coyote, `_Mono` c19r RSI and
  gunshot sound, `WeaponCaseLongC19r` (T5 dungeon loot) and `MailCSC19r` added to
  `RandomNFMailDeliveryPool` at 0.1.

## 16. 2026-10 Stechkin APS (Sandstorm BYOND port)

- Coyote does **not** have a Stechkin; Sandstorm Station 13 does
  (`code/modules/projectiles/guns/ballistic/pistol.dm`, `/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol/APS`:
  9mm, burst 3, semi/burst/full-auto, suppressor-capable).
- **`PSWeaponPistolStechkinAPS`** (`_PS/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Pistols/stechkin_aps.yml`):
  machine pistol frame + .35 high capacity chamber (this fork has no 9mm, so it uses .35 auto;
  Frontier has no suppressor system either), `Gun` set to SemiAuto/Burst/FullAuto with
  `shotsPerBurst: 3`.
- **Sprite**: `_PS/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Pistols/stechkin_aps.rsi` - `icon`/`base` from the DMI
  `aps` state, `bolt-open` from `aps-e`, inhands from the generic SS13 `gun` state
  (`icons/mob/inhands/weapons/guns_{left,right}hand.dmi`), belt/suit-storage sprites from the
  shared SS14 pistol art (`viper.rsi`). DMI cells were extracted with the zTXt/Pillow method
  (frame-major, direction-minor S/N/E/W; 2x2 RSI sheet layout).
- **Obtainable**: `WeaponCaseShortStechkinAPS` dungeon case (expedition variant
  `PSWeaponPistolStechkinAPSExpedition`, T2 ranged loot next to the Viper) and both WeaponryWorks
  (emagged black market) inventories, plus the DEBUG guns vendor.

## 17. 2026-10 Desert Eagle (ammo-fed Anaconda sibling)

- **`PSWeaponPistolDesertEagle`** (`_PS/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Pistols/desert_eagle.yml`):
  a normal magazine-fed heavy pistol using the Anaconda sprite (the Anaconda itself is a
  battery-fabricated gun). Parent `[NFBaseWeaponPistolChamber45, CSBaseWeaponFrameHeavyPistolCybersun]`;
  takes `NFMagazinePistol45` (8 rounds) and `NFCartridgePistol45`, inheriting the heavy pistol class,
  C2 contraband and Cybersun manufacturer details.
- **Sprites**: `_PS/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Pistols/desert_eagle.rsi`, copied from the Anaconda RSI with
  added `base`/`bolt-open` (icon copies) and a transparent `mag-0` state so the magazine-fed gun
  renders (the Anaconda has no mag/bolt states).
- **Sounds**: `Gunshots/deagle.ogg`, `MagIn/de_clipin.ogg`, `MagOut/de_clipout.ogg` and
  `Bolt/de_slideback.ogg` (rack). `Cock/de_clipin.ogg` is a byte-identical duplicate of the MagIn
  file and is currently unused.
- **Obtainable**: both WeaponryWorks emagged (black market) inventories, the DEBUG guns vendor and
  (since §18) dungeon/asteroid loot.
- **Ammo (updated in §18)**: the Desert Eagle now accepts `.50 AE`, `.44 Magnum` and `.357 Magnum`
  magazines (`CSMagazine50AE`, `CSMagazine44`/`CSMagazine44Automag`, `CSMagazine357`) as well as
  those cartridges in the chamber; those calibers were added natively in §18.

## 18. 2026-10 Fallout weapon port (coyote-bayou, 29 weapons + 11 calibers)

### Weapons

Ported from `BYOND/coyote-bayou` under the `_CS` prefix, one file per class in
`_CS/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Fallout/`:

- **Pistols**: `CSWeaponPistolAutomag` (.44 Mag), `CSWeaponPistolM93R` (9mm, burst),
  `CSWeaponPistolM9FS`, `CSWeaponPistolHiPower`, `CSWeaponPistolM1911` (.45 pistol),
  `CSWeaponPistolMakarov`, `CSWeaponPistolSkorpion` (9mm, full auto).
- **Revolvers**: `CSWeaponRevolverColtSAA` (.45 LC), `CSWeaponRevolver44` (.44 Mag),
  `CSWeaponRevolverTaurusJudge` (3x .50 shells), `CSWeaponRevolverSW45` (.45 pistol, 7 rounds).
- **SMGs**: `CSWeaponSubMachineGunUzi`, `...American180` (.22, integrally suppressed),
  `...P90` (10mm), `...MP5`, `...PPSh`.
- **Rifles**: `CSWeaponRifleM1Garand` (.30-06), `...M1A1` (10mm), `...ScarL` (5mm),
  `...AUGA10` (5mm), `...Mosin` (7.62x54R), `...SKS` (.308).
- **LMGs**: `CSWeaponLightMachineGunBAR`, `...M1919`, `...RPD`, `...DP27` (all .308).
- **Shotgun**: `CSWeaponShotgunSaiga12` (.50 shells, 8-round magazine).
- **Bows**: `CSWeaponBowComposite` (arrows), `CSWeaponCrossbowMarksman` (bolts).

- Sprites in `_CS/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Fallout/<Name>.rsi` (`icon`/`base`, `bolt-open`, `mag-0`,
  4-dir inhands and equipped sprites). Extracted from the coyote-bayou DMIs with the
  zTXt/Pillow method; `bolt-open` uses the source `-e`/`-open` state when present, equipped-back
  sprites come from `modular_coyote/icons/objects/back.dmi` when available and the shared SS14
  rifle art otherwise, belt/suit storage from the shared SS14 pistol art.
- Sounds copied from `sound/f13weapons/` into `Resources/Audio/_CS/Weapons/Fallout/`.
- Chamber bases (`CSBaseWeapon...Chamber...`) in `.../Fallout/bases.yml` set the magazine
  whitelist (`CSMagazine*` tags), examine caliber and revolver chambers.
- Fire modes/rates adapted from the BYOND rpm values (rpm / 60 = SS14 `fireRate`).

### Calibers

11 new native calibers under `_CS/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Guns/Ammunition/`:
**9mm, 10mm, .22 LR, .44 Magnum, .357 Magnum, .50 AE, .45 Long Colt, 5mm, .308, .30-06, 7.62x54R**.

- Full 7-variant families (Standard, Overpressure, Incendiary, Uranium, Practice, Rubber, EMP) for
  cartridges, projectiles and ammo boxes; magazines ship in standard, empty and all 6 variant
  versions, matching the Frontier convention.
- Cartridges reuse the upstream pistol/magnum/rifle casing RSIs with tinted tips.
- Magazine sprites extracted from `icons/fallout/objects/guns/ammo.dmi`; box sprites from the
  same DMI (one box per caliber). Magazine fill levels use the source's ammo-count states
  (`mag-0` = the source `-0` empty sprite, `mag-5` = the full sprite, intermediate counts where
  the source has them, e.g. `uzi9mm-4..32`, `762belt-20..80`, `enbloc-0..8`). The PPSh drum,
  American 180 drum and Saiga magazine have pixel-identical empty/full sprites in the source, so
  those look the same regardless of fill.
- `.45 ACP` reuses the existing `.45 pistol` family, 12 gauge reuses `.50 shells`, and the
  SCAR-L/AUG use the source's 5mm (not 5.56). Arrows/bolts reuse the existing bow ammunition.
- Tags in `_CS/tags.yml`, examine-caliber locale in `Resources/Locale/en-US/_CS/weapons/gun-examine.ftl`,
  lathe recipes (ammo boxes + empty magazines) in `_CS/Recipes/Lathes/fallout_ammo.yml`.
- **Recipe exposure** (mirrors how Frontier exposes its own ammo): standard boxes + empty
  magazines added to the `NFBasicAmmunitionProduction` tech node, pistol overpressure to
  `NFImprovedPistolAmmo`, rifle overpressure to `NFImprovedRifleAmmo`, rubber to
  `NFNonlethalAmmunition`; the same recipes added to the `NFBlueprintsMercenaryNfsd` blueprint
  pack; overpressure/incendiary/uranium boxes added to the mercenary/syndicate ammo blueprint
  disks; practice boxes added to the `NfsdPracticeStatic` lathe pack. EMP boxes stay
  research-locked exactly like Frontier's own EMP ammo.

### Loot

- `_CS/Catalog/Fills/Items/weapon_cases_fallout.yml`: one `RareWeaponCase` per gun (30, including
  the Desert Eagle) with magazines/ammunition.
- `_CS/Entities/Markers/Spawners/Random/weapon_tables_fallout.yml`: `TableDungeonLootWeaponsFallout`
  (all Fallout ports) and `TableDungeonLootWeaponsPalmtreePrevious` (AKM, C-19r, Anaconda, pulse
  rifle, energy revolver, Stechkin APS).
- Nested into dungeon ranged T4 (weight 0.15) and T5 (weight 0.15) and into
  `SalvageEquipmentLegendary` (asteroid salvage, weights 0.5/0.3).

## 19. 2026-10 Balance + polish pass (CSS sounds, fire rates, per-gun damage)

- **Garand ping**: `CSWeaponRifleM1Garand` auto-ejects its en-bloc clip with
  `Audio/_CS/Weapons/Fallout/garand_ping.ogg`. Vanilla auto-eject triggers the moment the magazine
  drains - which is one shot early, because that last round is moved into the chamber - so
  `MagazineAmmoProviderComponent.autoEjectDeferChambered` (new field, shared) defers both the eject
  and the sound until the chambered round has been fired too. Only enabled on the Garand, so the
  C-20r/C-19r auto-eject behaviour is unchanged.
- **Bows**: the composite bow was invisible because `BaseBow` defines no sprite layers; it now has
  `unwielded`/`wielded` layers (source `composite_unloaded`/`composite_loaded` states) plus a
  `GenericVisualizer` for wielding. The marksman crossbow was missing `icon-string-drawn`
  (ERROR sprite when drawn); the state now exists and the crossbow spawns with a loaded
  `CrossbowBolt` (`ItemSlots.projectiles.startingItem`).
- **CSS sound sets**: user-provided sounds copied into `Resources/Audio/Weapons/Guns/`
  (`Gunshots/{ak47,aug,awp,m4a1,p90}.ogg` plus MagIn/MagOut/Bolt/Misc extras) and wired to
  `CSWeaponAssaultRifleAKM` (ak47), `CSWeaponRifleAUGA10` (aug), `NFWeaponRifleSniperHristov`
  (awp), `NFWeaponRifleAssaultNovaliteC1` (m4a1) and `CSWeaponSubMachineGunP90` (p90) - gunshot,
  magazine in/out and rack sounds (insert/rack for the Hristov's internal magazine). No gun
  variants were created; the sounds simply replace the old ones.
- **Fire rates**: ported LMGs x4 (BAR 10, M1919 13.2, RPD 6.68, DP-27 10), rifles x2 (M1 Garand 3,
  M1A1 6, SCAR-L 3.34, AUG 3.34, Mosin 1.6, SKS 4), SMGs x2.5 (Uzi/MP5/P90 8.25, American 180/PPSh
  12.5; P90 burst 10.75); previously added AKM 6.4, Novalite 6.4 and Hristov 1.6.
- **Per-gun damage**: new `GunDamageMultiplierComponent` (`Content.Shared/_PS/Weapons`) and
  `GunDamageMultiplierSystem` (`Content.Server/_PS/Weapons`) scale projectile damage at hit time
  based on the firing weapon (`ProjectileComponent.Weapon`). Applied to AKM, AUG, Novalite and P90
  (x1.25) and Hristov (x3). Needed because SS14 damage lives on the ammunition and those guns share
  calibers with Frontier weapons.
